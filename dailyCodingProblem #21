"""
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
  1. Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
  2. Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's gradeaccording to these rules:
  1. If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up 
     to the next multiple of 5.
  2. If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a 
     failing grade.

Input Format:
  The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
  Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].
  
Example Input:
  4
  73
  67
  38
  33

Example Output:
  75
  67
  40
  33
