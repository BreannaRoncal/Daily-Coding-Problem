Alternating Characters

You are given a string containing characters "A" and "B" only. Your task is to change it into 
a string such that there are no matching adjacent characters. To do this, you are allowed to 
delete zero or more characters in the string.

Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions.

Input Format:
  The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries.
  The next q lines each contain a string to analyze.
  
Example Input:
    5
    AAAA
    BBBBB
    ABABABAB
    BABABA
    AAABBB
    
Example Output:
    3
    4
    0
    0
    4
