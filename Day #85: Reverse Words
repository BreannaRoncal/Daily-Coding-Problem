Reverse Words

Given a string s, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by spaces.

Note: The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included.

Examples :
  Input: s = " i like this program very much "
  Output: "much very program this like i"
  Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string (not individual words), the input string becomes "much very program this like i". 

  Input: s = " pqr mno "
  Output: "mno pqr"
  Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string, the input string becomes "mno pqr". 

  Input: s = " a "
  Output: "a"
  Explanation: The input string contains only one word with extra spaces around it. After removing the extra spaces, the output is "a".Constraints:

Constraints:
  1 <= s.size() <= 10^6
  String s contains only lowercase English alphabets and spaces.
