Breaking the Records

Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She 
tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. 
Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Complete the breakingRecords function in the editor below. It must return an integer array containing the 
numbers of times she broke her records. Index 0 is for breaking most points records, and index 1 is for 
breaking least points records.

    breakingRecords has the following parameter(s):
        -scores: an array of integers

Input Format:
    The first line contains an integer n, the number of games.
    The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of each
    game's score.
    
Example Input:
    9
    10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
    
Example Output:
    2 4
