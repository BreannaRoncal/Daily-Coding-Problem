Making Anagrams

A student is taking a cryptography class and has found anagrams to be very useful. Two strings are 
anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string. 
In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency. For example, 
bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.

The student decides on an encryption scheme that involves two large strings. The encryption is dependent 
on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Determine this number.

Given two strings, a and b, that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of 
character deletions required to make a and b anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

Complete the makeAnagram function in the editor below.

    makeAnagram has the following parameter(s):
        -string a: a string
        -string b: another string
        -return int: the minimum total characters that must be deleted

Input Format:
    The first line contains a single string, a.
    The second line contains a single string, b.
    
Example Input:
    cde
    abc

Example Output:
    4
