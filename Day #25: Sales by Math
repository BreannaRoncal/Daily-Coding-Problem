Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with 
matching colors there are.

Complete the sockMerchant function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the 
number of matching pairs of socks that are available.

sockMerchant has the following parameter(s):
    -n: the number of socks in the pile
    -ar: the colors of each sock

Input Format:
    -The first line contains an integer n, the number of socks represented in ar.
    -The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the colors ar[i] of the socks 
     in the pile.

Example Input:
  9
  10 20 20 10 10 30 50 10 20
