"""
Between Two Sets
There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
    1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
    2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are 
betwen the sets.

getTotalX has the following parameter(s):
    -int a[n]: an array of integers
    -int b[m]: an array of integers

Input Format:
    The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and m, the number of elements in arrays a and b.
    The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers a[i] where 0 <= i < n.
    The third line contains m distinct space-separated integers b[j] where 0 <= j < m.
    
Example Input:
  2 3
  2 4
  16 32 96
  
Example Output:
  3
