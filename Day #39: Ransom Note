Hash Tables: Ransom Note

Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will be traced back to him through his handwriting. 
He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of 
his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot 
use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using 
whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.

Input Format:
    The first line contains two space-separated integers, m and n, the numbers of words in the "magazine"and the "note".
    The second line contains m space-separated strings, each magazine[i].
    The third line contains n space-separated strings, each note[i].
    
Example Input:
    6 5
    two times three is not four
    two times two is four

Example Output:
    No
