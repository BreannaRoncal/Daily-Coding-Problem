Number Line Jumps

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a 
number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
  -The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
  -The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of 
the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

Complete the function kangaroo. It should return YES if they reach the same position at the same time, 
or NO if they don't.

kangaroo has the following parameter(s):
  x1, v1: integers, starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
  x2, v2: integers, starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2

Input Format:
  A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of x1, v1, x2, and v2.
  0 < x1 < x2 <= 10000
  0 <= v1 <= 10000
  0 <= v2 <= 10000
  
Example Input:
  0 3 4 2
  
Example Output:
  YES

Example Input:
  0 2 5 3
  
Example Output:
  NO
